# Educates Workshop Authoring Skill

This skill provides guidance for creating interactive workshops for the Educates training platform.

## Initial Workshop Creation

When the user asks to create a workshop, follow these steps:

### 1. Gather Workshop Details

Collect the following information from the user or infer from context:

- **Title**: A short, human-readable title for the workshop
- **Description**: A one to two sentence description of what the workshop covers
- **Name**: A machine-readable identifier (lowercase, dashes allowed, max 25 characters, should start with `lab-` prefix)

If the user provides a topic but not explicit values, propose reasonable defaults and confirm before proceeding.

### 2. Determine Workshop Location

Ask the user to choose one of:
- Use the current directory as the workshop root
- Create a new subdirectory using the workshop name

### 3. Determine Workshop Requirements

The terminal application is always enabled by default. Always include it explicitly with `enabled: true` and `layout: split` for clarity.

Ask the user about additional session applications based on the workshop's technical requirements:

- **Editor**: Will users need to edit or view files in the browser?
- **Kubernetes access**: Will users run kubectl commands or interact with the Kubernetes API?
- **Kubernetes console**: Would a visual cluster view help users?
- **Docker**: Will users build or run containers?
- **Image registry**: Will users push container images?
- **Virtual cluster**: Does the workshop need cluster-admin operations?

Infer sensible defaults from the workshop topic. For example, a Kubernetes workshop likely needs editor, Kubernetes access, and console enabled.

### 4. Create Workshop Structure

Create the following directory structure in the chosen location:

```
<workshop-root>/
├── README.md                    # Workshop title and description
├── resources/
│   └── workshop.yaml            # Educates Workshop definition
└── workshop/
    └── content/                 # Workshop instruction pages (Markdown)
```

### 5. Generate workshop.yaml

Refer to [resources/workshop-yaml-reference.md](resources/workshop-yaml-reference.md) for the complete workshop.yaml structure and options.

Generate the `resources/workshop.yaml` file based on the gathered details.

**CRITICAL: Use the correct publish and workshop.files format.**

The workshop.yaml MUST include these sections with this exact structure (substituting the actual workshop name):

```yaml
spec:
  publish:
    image: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
  workshop:
    files:
    - image:
        url: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
      includePaths:
      - /workshop/**
      - /exercises/**
      - /README.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use `spec.content.files` — this is a deprecated format. Always use `spec.publish` and `spec.workshop.files` as shown above. The `$(image_repository)` and `$(workshop_version)` variables must be used exactly as shown to support local workshop publishing and deployment workflows.

**Additional configuration:**

- Set `metadata.name` to the workshop name
- Set `spec.title` and `spec.description` from gathered details
- Set `spec.duration` to estimated completion time (e.g., `15m`, `30m`, `1h`)
- Set `spec.difficulty` to one of: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `extreme`
- Always include terminal with `enabled: true` and `layout: split`
- Enable only the additional session applications the workshop requires
- Set `security.token.enabled: false` by default (it is enabled by default for historical reasons)
- Only set `security.token.enabled: true` if the workshop needs kubectl or uses the Kubernetes console
- Omit any applications that are not needed (do not include with `enabled: false`)

### 6. Create Workshop Instructions

Workshop instructions are placed in the `workshop/content/` directory as Markdown files rendered by Hugo.

#### Page Structure

Each page requires YAML frontmatter with at least a `title` property:

```markdown
---
title: Page Title
---

This is the introductory paragraph for the page. It appears immediately
after the frontmatter with no heading.

## First Section

Content for the first section...

## Second Section

Content for the second section...
```

**Content guidelines:**

- Use standard Markdown for page content
- Do NOT use a level 1 heading (`#`) — the `title` in frontmatter automatically generates the page header
- Begin immediately with an introductory paragraph after the frontmatter
- Use level 2 headings (`##`) and below for any additional sections

#### File Naming Convention

Use a numeric prefix for ordering pages: `nn-page-name.md`

Recommended structure:
- `00-workshop-overview.md` - Introduction and objectives
- `01-first-topic.md` - First instructional page
- `02-second-topic.md` - Continue incrementing for core content
- `99-workshop-summary.md` - Wrap-up and next steps

Reserve `00-` for the overview and `99-` for the summary. Core instructional pages start at `01-` and increment.

#### Page Bundles

For simple pages, use a single `.md` file. For pages with embedded images local to that page, use a page bundle instead:

```
workshop/content/
├── 00-workshop-overview.md
├── 01-first-topic/
│   ├── index.md
│   └── diagram.png
├── 02-second-topic.md
└── 99-workshop-summary.md
```

A page bundle is a directory containing `index.md` plus any associated assets (images, etc.).

## Skill Version

When asked about the skill version, read the `VERSION.txt` file and report its contents to the user.
