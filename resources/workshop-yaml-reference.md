# Workshop Definition Reference (workshop.yaml)

This document describes the structure and configuration options for the Educates `workshop.yaml` file.

## Document Structure Overview

**Note:** Snippets throughout this document show partial YAML. Each snippet includes a path comment indicating where it belongs in the overall structure.

## Base Template

```yaml
apiVersion: training.educates.dev/v1beta1
kind: Workshop
metadata:
  name: "{workshop-name}"
spec:
  title: "{workshop-title}"
  description: "{workshop-description}"
  duration: 30m
  difficulty: beginner
  publish:
    image: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
  workshop:
    files:
    - image:
        url: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
      includePaths:
      - /workshop/**
      - /exercises/**
      - /README.md
  session:
    namespaces:
      budget: medium
      security:
        token:
          enabled: false
    applications:
      terminal:
        enabled: true
        layout: split
      editor:
        enabled: true
```

## Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `metadata.name` | Machine-readable identifier (lowercase, dashes allowed, max 25 chars, recommend `lab-` prefix) |
| `spec.title` | Human-readable workshop title |
| `spec.description` | One to two sentence description |
| `spec.duration` | Estimated completion time (e.g., `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`) |
| `spec.difficulty` | Target audience: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, or `extreme` |

## Workshop Files Configuration (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use this exact structure for workshop file publishing:**

```yaml
spec:
  publish:
    image: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
  workshop:
    files:
    - image:
        url: "$(image_repository)/{workshop-name}-files:$(workshop_version)"
      includePaths:
      - /workshop/**
      - /exercises/**
      - /README.md
```

Replace `{workshop-name}` with the actual workshop name from `metadata.name`.

The `/exercises/**` path is included because the `exercises/` directory receives special treatment: when it exists in the imported workshop files, terminals start with `~/exercises` as the working directory and the VS Code editor opens on it instead of the home directory. See the "exercises Directory" section in the main skill document for details.

**IMPORTANT:**
- The `$(image_repository)` and `$(workshop_version)` are variables that MUST be used exactly as shown
- These variables are required for local workshop publishing and deployment workflows
- **NEVER use `spec.content.files`** — this is a deprecated format and must not be used

## Session Applications

Ask the user which tools the workshop requires. Include only the applications that are needed.

All application settings belong under `spec.session.applications`.

### Terminal

The terminal is enabled by default and does not need to be explicitly enabled. However, it is recommended to include the configuration for clarity.

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  terminal:
    enabled: true
    layout: split
```

- **Default behavior**: Always enabled, even if omitted
- **Recommendation**: Always include `enabled: true` explicitly for clarity
- **Layout options**:
  - `default` - Single terminal
  - `split` - Two terminals stacked above each other in ratio 60/40 (recommended default)
  - `split/2` - Three terminals stacked above each other in ratio 50/25/25
  - `lower` - Single terminal placed below dashboard tabs rather than as a tab, ratio 70/30
  - `none` - No terminal displayed, but can still be created from drop down menu

### Editor

For viewing or editing files in the browser:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  editor:
    enabled: true
```

- **When to enable**: Workshops involving code editing, file creation, or viewing source files

### Kubernetes Console

For Kubernetes cluster visualization:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  console:
    enabled: true
```

- **When to enable**: Workshops teaching Kubernetes concepts where users benefit from a visual cluster view

### Docker Daemon

For building and running containers:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  docker:
    enabled: true
```

- **When to enable**: Workshops involving container building, Docker commands, or container runtime exercises

### Image Registry

For pushing/pulling container images:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  registry:
    enabled: true
```

- **When to enable**: Workshops where users need to push images to a registry (often paired with Docker)

### Virtual Cluster (vcluster)

For isolated Kubernetes environments:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session.applications
applications:
  vcluster:
    enabled: true
```

- **When to enable**: Workshops requiring cluster-admin operations or isolated Kubernetes environments

## Kubernetes Access

Kubernetes access via security token is enabled by default for historical reasons. Explicitly disable it unless the workshop requires it.

**When workshop does NOT need Kubernetes access:**

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  namespaces:
    budget: medium
    security:
      token:
        enabled: false
```

**When workshop DOES need Kubernetes access:**

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  namespaces:
    budget: medium
    security:
      token:
        enabled: true
```

- **Default behavior**: Security token is enabled by default (historical)
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly set `enabled: false` unless the workshop uses `kubectl`, interacts with the Kubernetes API, or uses the Kubernetes console

### ⚠️ Common Error from Old Documentation

**INCORRECT** - Do NOT use this pattern (missing `namespaces` level):

```yaml
# THIS IS INCORRECT - DO NOT USE
# Path: spec.session
session:
  security:
    token:
      enabled: true
```

Old Educates documentation incorrectly showed the `security` configuration directly under `spec.session`. This is wrong and will not work. The `security` configuration MUST be nested under `spec.session.namespaces.security`, not directly under `spec.session`. Always use the correct examples shown above.

## Workshop Labels

Workshop labels are metadata fields used for organizing and filtering workshops. These are distinct from Kubernetes labels in the `metadata` section.

**Correct format** (array of objects with `name` and `value` properties):

```yaml
# Path: spec.labels
labels:
- name: id
  value: educates.dev/lab-markdown-sample
- name: category
  value: getting-started
```

### ⚠️ Common Error from Old Documentation

**INCORRECT** - Do NOT use dictionary format:

```yaml
# THIS IS INCORRECT - DO NOT USE
# Path: spec.labels
labels:
  id: educates.dev/lab-markdown-sample
  category: getting-started
```

Old Educates documentation incorrectly showed labels as a dictionary (key-value pairs). This format is wrong. Always use the array format with objects containing `name` and `value` properties as shown in the correct example above.

## Session Ingresses

Session ingresses use the workshop session proxy to expose an HTTP service for browser access within the workshop. They are configured under `spec.session.ingresses`.

Each entry defines a named route through the session proxy. The proxy creates an externally accessible hostname of the form `{name}-$(session_hostname)` and forwards requests to the specified backend.

### Proxying to a Kubernetes Service

To proxy to a Kubernetes Service running in the session namespace, specify the `host` as the fully qualified service DNS name and the `port`:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  ingresses:
  - name: app
    protocol: http
    host: app.$(session_namespace).svc
    port: 8080
```

This routes `app-$(session_hostname)` through the session proxy to `app.$(session_namespace).svc:8080`. See the [Kubernetes Access Reference](kubernetes-access-reference.md) for more details on this variant, including when to prefer it over a manually created Kubernetes Ingress.

### Proxying to a Process in the Workshop Container

To proxy to a process running directly inside the workshop container (e.g., a web application started from the terminal), omit the `host` field. It defaults to `localhost`, routing to the specified port on the workshop container itself:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  ingresses:
  - name: app
    protocol: http
    port: 8080
```

This routes `app-$(session_hostname)` through the session proxy to `localhost:8080` inside the workshop container. Use this when the user starts an application process from the terminal that listens on a port and you want to make it accessible in the browser.

### Embedding in a Dashboard Tab

Combine `spec.session.ingresses` with `spec.session.dashboards` to embed a proxied service as a tab in the workshop dashboard:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  ingresses:
  - name: app
    protocol: http
    port: 8080
  dashboards:
  - name: App
    url: "$(ingress_protocol)://app-$(session_hostname)/"
```

The `name` in the dashboard entry is the label shown on the tab. The `url` must use `$(ingress_protocol)` to match the protocol Educates is running under (HTTP or HTTPS), and the hostname must match the ingress `name` prefixed to `$(session_hostname)`.

Workshop instructions can then reveal the dashboard tab at the appropriate point using the `dashboard:open-dashboard` clickable action:

````markdown
```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: App
```
````

**Why use session ingresses instead of direct URLs?** The session proxy provides automatic HTTPS when Educates is deployed with secure ingress, avoids mixed-content errors when embedding in iframes, and gates access through the same authentication as the workshop dashboard.

**IMPORTANT:** If you define a session ingress with a `name` of `app`, you cannot also have the user create a separate Kubernetes Ingress using a hostname of `app-$(session_hostname)`. The session proxy has already claimed that hostname.

## Decision Flowchart

When generating a workshop.yaml, determine:

1. **What is the workshop topic?** → Sets title and description
2. **Terminal configuration** → Always include with `enabled: true` and `layout: split` (terminal is enabled by default, but include explicitly for clarity)
3. **Does it involve editing code?** → Enable editor
4. **Does it need Kubernetes access?** → If yes, keep security token enabled; if no, explicitly disable with `enabled: false`
5. **Does it teach Kubernetes?** → Enable console (and keep security token enabled)
6. **Does it involve containers?** → Enable docker and possibly registry
7. **Does it need cluster-admin access?** → Enable vcluster
